Experiment with declarative oop

```
abstract class Saying {
  Future<String> say();
}
```

What all can we do with this interface ????

1. Clone this
2. `dart pub get`
3. `dart run`

`dart run` executes `bin/declarative_sayings.dart` and you can follow the code from there.

Things to notice:
* Constructors calling Constructors
* Methods calling Methods
* Lots of useful implementations of a simple interface
* How all the implementations work together
